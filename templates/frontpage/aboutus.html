Stephen Cooper
<br/>
	<div class = "bio">
		Steve Cooper is an Associate Professor (teaching) in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. He is currently on leave from Purdue University, where he serves as Professor of Computer Graphics Technology and as a Professor of Computer Science (courtesy). Prior to that, he was an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Saint Joseph's University and the Director its Center for Visualization. His research areas lie in program visualization and semantics. He has been working with Alice and developing Alice-related curricular materials since 1998. Along with Wanda Dann and the late Randy Pausch, he has written many technical papers on Alice, as well as two texts, Learning to Program with Alice (2009, Prentice-Hall) and Exploring Wonderland (2010, Prentice-Hall). The latter text, which includes Barbara Ericson as a co-author, integrates Alice and Media Computation into a single CS1 course. From 2007-2009, Steve worked in NSF's Division of Undergraduate Education, within its Education and Human Resources Directorate. There, he worked as a program manager, and worked on the CCLI, ATE, NSDL, SFS, and S-STEM programs.
		Current (funded) research projects on which he is working include the creation of a serious game to teach secure coding practices to novice programmers, incorporation of a cognitive tutoring system into Alice, and a new Google-like approach towards digital libraries to make them more usable. Another project on which he is working is towards creating a series of curricular guidelines for IA programs.
		Steve also serves as Vice President of the Board of Directors for the Computer Science Teachers Association.

Mehran Sahami
<br/>
	<div class = "bio">
		In 2007, I joined the Computer Science Department at Stanford University as Associate Professor (Teaching) and Associate Chair for Education. From 2001 to 2006, I also taught in the CS department at Stanford as a Lecturer. From 2002-2007, I was a full-time Senior Research Scientist at Google. After moving to Stanford, I continued to consult at Google part-time until 2010. My research interests include computer science education, machine learning, and information retrieval on the Web. Please see my publications web page for more information.
		Previously, I worked for several years as a Senior Engineering Manager at Epiphany. Prior to working at Epiphany, I completed my PhD in the Computer Science Department at Stanford. I was also an undergrad at Stanford and I loved it so much that I didn't want to leave.
		Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with family, playing the guitar, going on outdoor excursions, and sleeping (which seems to be getting rarer and rarer these days). I also continue to maintain a foot in the start-up world by serving on advisory boards to various companies.

Paulo Blikstein
<br/>
	<div class = "bio">
		Paulo Blikstein is an assistant professor at Stanford University’s School of Education and (by courtesy) Computer Science Department. Blikstein’s research focus on the confluence of expressive technologies for learning and critical pedagogy. He adapts cutting-edge technologies for use in inner-city schools, such as computer modeling, robotics, and rapid prototyping, creating constructionist learning environments in which children learn science and mathematics by building sophisticated projects and devices. His research interests also include the applications of complexity sciences in education and computational literacy, particularly the new knowledge representation infrastructures emerging from the use of computational representations.
		Blikstein has worked extensively with inner city students in developing countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, Senegal, and Costa Rica, and also in the US. He completed his PhD. at the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at Northwestern University, and holds a B.S. in Metallurgical Engineering and a MEng. in Digital Systems Engineering from the University of São Paulo, Brazil (1998, 2001), as well as a MSc. degree from the MIT Media Lab (2002), where he was also a visiting scholar (2003). Outside of academia, Paulo studied Film and directed scientific documentaries. Paulo has published several book chapters and papers about his work in education (most available at <a href="http://www.blikstein.com/paulo">http://www.blikstein.com/paulo</a>).

	<div class = "bio">
		I recently received my Master's in Computer Science from Stanford University. Before this, for six years, I built search-engines. Not surprisingly, I like engineering very large-scale	systems, spend nights coding furiously, and hope that robots take over the world. No, really.
